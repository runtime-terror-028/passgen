# passgen

passgen is a command-line tool made using Deno and Cliffy. It helps you generate random passwords based on the options you give. You can choose what type of characters to include, how long the password should be, and whether to show it in the terminal or save it as a `.txt` file.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have [Deno](https://deno.land/) installed.

2. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runtime-terror-028/passgen

cd passgen

deno run start
```
